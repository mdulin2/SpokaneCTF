After doing a test run of this challenge we discovered it was too hard for people not into crypto to do. So, the challenge is split into two parts: understanding RSA and breaking the encryption key. 



You are the evil Eve, who has intercepted the message "44911" going from Bob to Alice, whose public key is n = 97709 and e = 51767. You notice these keys are quite small; hence, you decide to break them to figure out the cipher text. The **flag** for this challenge is the original message sent.  

* This uses RSA encryption.
* Know how RSA encryption works. Also, co-prime, inverse-modulo and totient function are. With these tools, the challenge can be done!
