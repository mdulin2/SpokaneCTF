This is only the initial idea of how the competition is going to happen. If the people want something else, then please speak up!


# Competition
## General
- 6 hours.
- At Gonzaga
- Food will hopefully be provided?
- Teams of 1-4. If there are two freshman on the team, then a team is allowed 5 or 6. Freshman are highly encouraged because we want them to come and learn!
- Slack channel for teams to communicate.
## Rules
- No external, automated tools besides nmap (I'm talking about using Kali and other things). Using google for answers is completely fine though.
- No DOS attacks on machines.
- Do not attack the scoreboard site.
- Two types of challenges:
    - Attack/Defense:
        - This will consist of defending your own box, while trying to exploit others.
        - Will need to keep your service up and running!
        - Flags will rotate on 'ticks', likely to be an hour.
        - 4/5 total: 1 released per hour.
     - Wargame/ Jeopardy

## Scoring
- Solving a wargame will give x number of points, depending on the difficulty and effort needed to solve the challenge. More points given to the first 3 teams for solving the challenge.
- For the wargames, sending in write ups of mitigation reports will be extra points, if correct.
- Attacking another teams box will give the flag for the challenge.
- Teams will be subtracted points if their service is down/does not work.
- Defensively, if a malicious payload is seen, then report this to the officials for extra points. Should probably be some sort of cap on this.
- Harden the system, not about hardening the flag.
- Some of the wargames will be very weird to judge. So, people (known as judges) will manually have to look at them. This includes the XSS challenge, "I'm in" moment mitgiations and more.
- Hints are allowed by the people around. However, points will be taken off for this. Want the opportunity for people to have fun and solve challenges though!

## Atmosphere
- Should be a fun and learning atomsphere.
- People should be helpful.
