The Samsung Android Phone manufacturer has made a crucial mistake! They have left the Android Debugger Port (ABD) open on thousands of S5 galaxy phones that have just been released. You have snagged the phone and want to steal all the information you can from it...

- This challenge has two parts to it:
    - A wargame challenge for simply connecting to the ADB and finding the flag.
    - Who can cause the most havoc on it? Judges will give out points according to what they find worthwhile.

- Tips:
    - Use Linux terminal with adb to connect; this makes life much, much easier!
    - ADB can be very annoying to get working... So, ensuring that the previous connection is no more...
    - The phone asks if it's okay for the IP to use the ADB; make sure to have the phone at this point to check this off!

This challenge is only one team at a time though! So, a sign up sheet or something will needed... Half hour intervals?
