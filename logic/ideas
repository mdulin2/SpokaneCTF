- NAS system!
	- Upload files
	- Basic commands on the OS with a whitelist of ls, cat, stat and file.
	- Load files:
		- Execute a file
		- Get the file from the NAS server

Currently two vulns:
- The blacklisting of characters forgot to ban &&.
- The input validation does not happen from bash execution from a file. So, this lets a bash script to do whatever it wants, without restrictions. Poor sanitization. Both fairly easy to patch; one or two line fixes!
