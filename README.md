# SpokaneCTF 2019

Each one of these folders is a class of CTF challenges. 

- Cats, OSINT_machine and Korean Food are attack/defense challenges for the contest. 
- Everything else is in the wargame section. 
- Scoreboard is a forked repo in mdulin2s repository all ctforge. 

So far, we have 7 colleges schools involved (Eastern Washington, Spokane Falls, SCC, Lewis Clark State, North Idaho College, Whitworth and Gonzaga) and 3 high schools (Ferris, North Central and Rogers).  

Within each folder is a **Challenge** file for the person doing the challenge to read before doing the challenge. Within the **Info.md** file (sometimes other files) there are also the file structures of each challenge, how it created and how it is to be solved. 
Other than the people from the schools, were are trying to get community members as well.
