# SpokaneCTF

Each one of these folders is a CTF challenge! An attack and defense challenge should have a deploy, connect, reset and shutdown script, for the user. 

The war game or jeopardy challenges are up to who ever is creating it! 

Other things that need to be built are a scoreboard (which I believe Trevor is going to take the lead on) and  website for the competition (which is going to be known as the Mayors Cyber Cup) 



So far, we have four schools involved (Eastern Washington, Spokane Falls, Whitworth and Gonzaga). We would still like to get the other Spokane Community College and Idaho to get a team sent out. 

Current Reps: 
- Maxwell Dulin: Gonzaga
- Trevor Greenside: Gonzaga
- Andrew Yang: Gonzaga
- Rodney Thomas: Eastern Washington 
- Utsal: Whitworth 
- Andrew Frunk : Spokane Falls 
- Brady Nielsen: Spokane Falls

Other than the people from the schools, were are trying to get community members as well. At the moment a few companies have showed interest: 

Companies: 
- Gravwell
- Intrinium 

However, I would like to get another company, industry cyber person or someone eelse as an asset.
