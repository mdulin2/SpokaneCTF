# SpokaneCTF

Each one of these folders is a class of CTF challenges. 

- Cats, OSINT_machine and Korean Food are attack/defense challenges 
- Everything else is in the wargame section. 
- Scoreboard is a forked repo in mdulin2s repository. 

So far, we have 7 colleges schools involved (Eastern Washington, Spokane Falls, SCC, Lewis Clark State, North Idaho College, Whitworth and Gonzaga) and 3 high schools (Ferris, North Central and Rogers). Practically at max capacity. 

Current Reps: 
- Maxwell Dulin: Gonzaga
- Trevor Greenside: Gonzaga
- Andrew Yang: Gonzaga
- Rodney Thomas: Eastern Washington 
- RJ Garcia: SFCC
- Juan Ford: SFCC 
- etc.

Other than the people from the schools, were are trying to get community members as well. At the moment a few companies have showed interest: 

Companies: 
- Gravwell
- Intrinium 
- Spokane Security Coalition
- Risk Lens
However, I would like to get another company, industry cyber person or someone else as an asset.
