adventure.c - The text adventure code written for the challenge
adventure - The executable for the challenge. 

This is going to be a attack/defense challenge... Which means that a client-server will need to be added to this challenge. Also, the deploy, shutdown, connect and reset script will need to be written.

The exploit is in the name at the beginning of the challenge. Put 50 of the '%x' character, then change the hex chars to ascii. From there, you should see the flag, which is currently Jackie Moon.
