# Finding a key on the system

Written by Maxwell Dulin   

- answer.py is the solution to the problem that Maxwell Dulin wrote.
- cipher.txt and huffman are the two files given to the hackers.
- bible.txt is the bible, or the wordset that the huffman algorithm was used to get character frequencies.
- Huff.py is the implementation of the huffman encoding algorithm.
- 1 and m.zip are just interesting files because of file size. In theory, it is possible to try to decompress a file (to make it smaller) but then make it larger. This is what happened in this case.
- Challenge.md has the challenge that will be given to the hackers. The files given to the hackers will be the challenge file, huffman and cipher.txt.
