In post-apocalyptic world, computers are an extremely valuable tool. However, they are hard to find and tend to be encrypted in some manner. While digging through the depths of a computer you found a directory with two files: huffman and cipher.txt. You believe that the this could have the key that you are looking for to decrypt the computer, but it is encoded in a weird way.

Figure out what the key is using the huffman and cipher.txt files.

* Hint: You are going to need to do some programming in order to solve this problem.
