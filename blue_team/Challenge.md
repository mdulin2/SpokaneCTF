# Blue Team
# Challenge 
The entire point of the blue team challenges is to be able to recognize when malicious events are occuring. Be able to recognize these!  
To get points: 
* Find a malicious payload in the attack/defense challenges .pcap file. 
* Find a judge to talk to about the finding. 
* Explain why the payload is malicious.
* If the judge believes you understand the malicious attempt and the attempt was malicious then he will give you the passphrase associated with the challenge.  

Only one blue team challenge per attack/defense challenge. 
# Setup

For each attack/defense style challenge there will be one blue team challenge in the wargame section. The judges will have sheets with the flags for the blue team challenges. 
## Judgement

From blue team turn in 1, to blue team turn in 8
