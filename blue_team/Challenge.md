# Blue Team

The entire point of the blue team challenges is to be able to recognize when malicious events are occuring. Being able to recognize this!

# Setup

For each attack/defense style challenge there will be two different blue team turnins on the wargame scoreboard. The blue team notice will be sent via email to @someemail where the judge will determine if the payload is actually malicious or not. If the payload is malicious, then the judge will send the coresponding flag, which will then be submitted to the scoreboard for points. 

## Judgement
How to judge this? Should probably ask Jake about this
