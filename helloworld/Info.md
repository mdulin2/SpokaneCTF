I thought it would be really nice to have two 'hello world'ish problems for the students.   

# Inspection
One of the first CTF challenges that I did was just finding the flag within the HTML of a page. So, I thought this would be a good low point challenge to have. Simply just open up the dev tools and the flag will be in a comment on the page.

# SSH
We may think logging into a box is trivial. But, some people may not have ever used SSH before. So, this challenge will be to simply log into a server using a username and password. Then, on the box, will be a directory called flag; this will be the answer.
