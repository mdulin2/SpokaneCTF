Cracking the keys of an encryption algorithm should be very hard! However, how do we determine if something is hard or not? Mainly, this is determined by the difficulty of the problem. In the case of RSA, the algorithm is secured by the difficulty of factoring numbers. 

Now, given an RSA public key N, how many division computations are needed to guarentee the factors p and q are found? 
Use N = 519920566100540349463.
