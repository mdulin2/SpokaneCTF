The organization problem, where values are being removed as options, can be turned into a factorial format. So, with 200 tiles the answer is 200! or 788657867364790503552363213932185062295135977687173263294742533244359449963403342920304284011984623904177212138919638830257642790242637105061926624952829931113462857270763317237396988943922445621451664240254033291864131227428294853277524242407573903240321257405579568660226031904170324062351700858796178922222789623703897374720000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Enjoy!

A good practice for this would be to think about 3 books; label them x1,x2,x3. Here are the possible ways to order the books.
- x1,x2,x3
- x1,x3,x2
- x2,x1,x3
- x2,x3,x1
- x3,x1,x2
- x3,x2,x1

Notice that 3! = 6, the same as the amount of answers above.
