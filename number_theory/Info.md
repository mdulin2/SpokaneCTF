# Number Theory Problems
In some situations, the need to brute force an answer may be needed. But, how can we determine if the brute forcing the algorithm is possible? In order to do this, we can calculate values to simulate the amount of possible outcomes. These problems are about <i>understanding</i> the process for figuring out these values.

## Files:
There are 3 different challenges in here: keys_check.md, password_combo.md and puzzle.md. All of these have answer an challenge file and an answer file, found by adding an `_ans` to the name of the file.

- keys_check.md/keys_check_ans.md: The challenge is about figuring out the amount of possible values that p and q could be within the RSA algorithm.
- password_combo.md/password_combo_ans.md: The challenge is about understanding the amount of possible passwords, given certain restrictions.
- puzzle.md/puzzle_ans.md: This challenge is about understanding the different possible arrangements of the tiles on the floor.
